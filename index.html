        </ul>
        <h3>Security Of Data</h3>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
        or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to
        provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our
        Service is used.</p>
        <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website
        traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is
        shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and
        personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>
        <p>For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms web
        page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>This app contains Ads, and the platform used is AdMob by Google.</p>
        <h3>Discussion comments</h3>
        <p>We allow visitors to discuss articles on our blog via third party discussion apps.
        Before you can leave a comment, you must first press a button which loads the discussion plugin.
        Depending on the date they were published, some articles use Disqus and others use the Facebook comments
        plugin. </p>
        <p>
        Once you have opted in to leaving comments, these plugins may track your visit to our site. Disqus and/or
        Facebook will know what pages you viewed and what you write in any comments you leave. Of course all
        comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your name, so we do not imagine this
        is a concern for many people.
        If you login via social network, the providers of these plugins will be able to link your activity to that
        network. In this way, your activity may be personally identifiable.
        </p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h3>Emails</h3>
        <p>We may send you email notifications regarding your service (such as invoices) or which you have specifically
        requested
        (such as newsletters or notifications when a report is completed). You have the ability to opt out of any of
        this communication at any time.</p>
        <p>We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are
        specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We take many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. These
        precautions include:</p>
        <p>Use of SSL encryption for sensitive data</p>
        <p>Hardware stored in secured data centers behind firewalls</p>
        <p>All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key</p>
        <p>Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location</p>
        <p>Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected we cannot guarantee the
        security of data sent over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Of course you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential.
        Nobody will ever ask you for your password, so please don’t trust anybody asking you for it. </p>
        
        
        <h3>Links To Other Sites</h3>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
        you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of
        every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
        third party sites or services.</p>
        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a
        parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact
        us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental
        consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
        <h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
